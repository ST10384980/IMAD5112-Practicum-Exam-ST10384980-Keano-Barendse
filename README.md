The Hydration Havan Application is an application that logs the users daily water intake. The primary goal of the application is to encourage users to drink water everyday for a week and estimate 
their weekly water intake averages. The user is first welcomed by our splash screen which displays the applications name and logo. The user is then presented with a screen that allows them to 
enter their names and student numbers. This initual screen will allow the user to enter their credentials and proceed further into the application with the Enter button or allow them to leave
the application with its Exit Button. After pressing the Enter button the user will then see their credentials on the second screen. Users are then permitted to proceed further by pressing the Enter button
which will take the user to the Main Screen. The Main Screen will then request that the user input their daily water intake by entering the Date, the Water Morning Intake, the Afternoon Water intake,
and their personal Notes. If the users did not enter all of the fields and pressed Save, it will populate an error message that request that the user enters all of the required fields. Then the users
can save the data and store it into the parcel but if the user is not happy with the entered data on the fields, users can use the Clear button to clear data from the fields. If the user wishes to leave
they can use the Exit button on the bottom of the Main Screen. Once the correct Data has been iputted the user can press Save and Next. This allow users to see their water intake averages for the 
morning and afternoon and this will round up to their weekly water intake. The user can then return to the Main Screen with the back button and enter their new data by entering their new daily water
intake. The purpose for the application is to ensure that users are aware of the critial issues regarding human dehydration and it promotes healthy living.
